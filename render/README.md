# SVGRenderer

A simple svg file toy renderer for practicing the rasterization algorithms I learnt.<br> 
The rasterization algorithm are all CPU-based. I draw the pixels in a memory buffer on CPU side, then use OpenGL API to copy the pixels to GPU side.<br>
Image below are the final result generated by this toy renderer.
